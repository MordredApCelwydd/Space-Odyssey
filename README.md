# Space-Odyssey
 Welcome to my second unity project!

 During the development of this project I improved my coding techniques, worked with Unity's physics system via the use of RigidBodies, learned about working with sound with AudioListeners and AudioMixers, as well as PostFX, particles and lightning. 

 In this game, your goal is to reach the end of level and avoid  crashing with obstacles.
W - Propel the rocket   
A/D - Turn left/right
N - Night vision!

 CHEAT BUTTONS:
L-invulnerability    
I/O - Switch levels
I - Disable obstacles  
L - Invulnerability
               
Good luck!
