# Space-Odyssey
 Welcome to my second unity project!

 During the development of this project I improved my coding techniques, worked with Unity's physics system via the use of RigidBodies, learned about working with sound with AudioListeners and AudioMixers, as well as PostFX, particles and lightning.
